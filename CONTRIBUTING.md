2. Edit the Readme ensuring the PR Guidelines are being followed
3. Update the Table of Contents (if needed)

## Updating your Pull Request

If you are asked to edit your PR due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the awesome-yazi list guidelines, please make suitable changes in your fork.

## Automated Plugin Count

The plugin count badge in the README is automatically updated by a GitHub Action workflow whenever the README is modified on the main branch. The workflow counts all `<details>` tags between the `## Plugins` and `## Flavors` sections.

If you need to manually update the count, you can run:
```bash
./update-plugin-count.sh
```

## Note

The plugin added will be reviewed before adding before any possible malicious additions in your and will also be frequently checked upon. This is to prevent any milicious plugin from reaching to the yazi community through awesome-yazi. Please cooperate with us. Thank you!
